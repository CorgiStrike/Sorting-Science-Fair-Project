## Introduction

This is a project created for my Honors Chemistry Science Fair Project. The program creates multiple datasets of varying sizes and sorts them using 10 different sorting algorithims. The datasets range from 1,000 items to 1,000,000 items, increasing by a factor of 10 each time. The 10 sorting algorithims used were "Bubble Sort", "Selection Sort", "Insertion Sort", "Merge Sort", "Quick Sort", "Heap Sort", "Counting Sort", "Radix Sort", "Shell Sort", and "Tim Sort".
